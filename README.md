# Stock Market Prediction Using Time Series Analysis and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock market movements using a combination of time series analysis and sentiment analysis from social media data. The traditional approach of relying solely on experience and daily headlines has been replaced by more sophisticated methods leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. By incorporating various international, national, political, and economic factors, along with sentiments and reactions of people over the issues, this prediction model strives to provide investors with better insights and potential profit opportunities.

## Motivation
Forecasting the Indian market has always been an intriguing topic for analysts and researchers. With the advent of machine learning and AI, the competition is now centered around implementing the best algorithms to yield higher returns for investors. Social media's growing influence has changed the market dynamics, and sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in determining investors' mood over the news. By harnessing the power of AI and sentiment analysis, this project seeks to improve the accuracy of market predictions and enable better decision-making for traders.

## Methodology
The project is divided into two main categories of prediction strategies:

1. **Time Series Analysis of Stocks:** This approach involves analyzing historical stock price data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality. Techniques like moving averages, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and exponential smoothing are employed to model the time series data.

2. **Artificial Intelligence Property over the Market:** This category encompasses various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including:
   - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Naive Bayes
   - Backpropagation Neural Networks
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

   The project explores the combination of these algorithms to leverage their strengths and improve prediction accuracy.

## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a crucial component of this project, which helps gauge the sentiment of investors over various news and events related to the stock market. The analysis of social media data enables understanding market sentiments in real-time, allowing for a more dynamic and responsive prediction model.

## Challenges
Building accurate prediction models for the stock market is not without its challenges. Some of the key hurdles addressed in this project include:
- Data quality and availability.
- Handling noisy data from social media platforms.
- Feature selection and engineering for both time series and sentiment data.
- Optimizing the combination of different AI algorithms.
- Dealing with inherent uncertainties in financial markets.

## LSTM Prediction Model
One of the highlights of this project is the LSTM prediction model. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have an advantage in analyzing the relationship between time series data through memory functions, making them suitable for stock market forecasting. The LSTM model is enhanced by combining time series data and sentiment analysis, leading to improved prediction performance.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Prepare the historical stock price data and social media data for analysis.
4. Execute the main prediction script, which combines time series analysis and sentiment analysis to generate predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of combining time series analysis and sentiment analysis for stock market prediction. By leveraging AI algorithms and social media data, the prediction model aims to provide valuable insights to investors, aiding them in making informed decisions. However, it's essential to remember that the stock market is inherently unpredictable, and no model can guarantee absolute accuracy. The results obtained from this project should be used as a supplementary tool in conjunction with thorough research and expert advice.
